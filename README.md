# Automation Time

- In the CS253 (Introduction to Software Development) Course, I acquired knowledge of writing bash scripts for basic tasks, such as file searching using the grep command. 

- After that I started wondering if we could control the keyboard and mouse using some scripts so that we can automate some basic tasks...

- Then I came to know about Selenium and tried to experiment what can be done using it
## ChatGPT

- Isn't it cool that how using the ChatGPT API Key how one can get responses to the querries just by using a few lines of code!

- But this free-key is valid only for the first 60 days of our account, which might have expired long ago. ( I came to know about this key long after my expired :( )

- To simulate the above, I wrote few lines of code in Selenium which would post my querries to ChatGPT in Chrome via my normal account and read back the responses into the code.

- To skip the process of log in etc, I used to open the Chrome Browser with my profile already loaded in Chrome

- Although the API also has several other benefits, but this also wasn't a bad option
## IRCTC

- For those who use IRCTC for ticket booking, I am sure you are aware that how uncertain we are on getting a confirm ticket when booking a Tatkal ticket. 

- While trying to automate this, I got stuck at one point where  Captcha was required to log in. Then Pytesseract, an OCR Library in Python came to the rescue. Since the Captcha used in IRCTC is just an image letters, so using it I was successfully able to decode it.

- Till now I have written the code to log in and enter the journey details.

Work in Progress...
